# PWMsense
Arduino PWM sensing library

Simple interrupt driven library for measuring parameters (duty cycle & frequency) of a PWM signal on any Arduino pin 
Uses EnableInterrupt library.

Supports ESP8266 also.

Includes 2 header files (can be used independently - actually 2 libraries in one) defining template fully static class and some global functions.

PWMinfo object (templetized by pin) PWMinfo<pin> obj installs ISR that records the timestamps of the last 2 signal level changes that are used to determine the frequency and the duty cycle of the signal. 
  obj::begin() - installs the ISR and starts monitoring the signal
  obj::end() - uninstalls the ISR (stops monitoring)
  obj::reset() - resets timestamps (starts monitoring from scratch)
  bool obj::valid() - returns true if the signal has changed sufficient times in order to determine the frequency and the duty 
  float obj::dutyCycle() - returns the duty of the signal in % (0-100) - estimate using the timings of the last cycle only
  float obj::prf() - returns the frequency of the signal in Hz  - estimate using the timings of the last cycle only
  
  global functions:
  OnePulseFreqEstimate<pin>(timeout) and OnePulseDutyEstimate<pin>(timeout) - deretmine the frequency / duty of the signal on the given pin and returns as soon as one full cycle or at most timeout milliseconds have passed
  
PWMsense object (templetized by pin) PWMsense<pin> obj installs ISR that continually records the signal averaging the calculated duty and frequency (during multiple cycles) of the signal. 
  obj::begin() - installs the ISR and starts monitoring the signal
  obj::end() - uninstalls the ISR (stops monitoring)
  obj::reset() - resets measures (starts monitoring from scratch)
  long int obj::pulseCount() - returns the number of times the signal has changed (either raised or fallen) since the begin or reset has been called 
  float obj::dutyCycle() - returns the duty of the signal in % (0-100) - averaged over all cycles since reset
  float obj::prf() - returns the frequency of the signal in Hz - averaged over all cycles since reset
  
  Global functions:
  FreqEstimate<pin>(timeout, n) and DutyEstimate<pin>(timeout, n) - determine the frequency / duty of the signal on the given pin and returns as soon as n full cycles or at most timeout milliseconds have passed
